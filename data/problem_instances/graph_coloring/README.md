# Graph Coloring Problems

The `examples` directory contains some relatively small graph coloring problems that can be used to try out the graph coloring algorithms.

The remaining directories are more systematized and contain more problems. Problems in `in_house` were generetaed in-house, while other directories contain problems taken from other sources, including [this collection of GCP Benchmark Instances](https://dynaroars.github.io/npbench/graphcoloring.html#fn.1).
