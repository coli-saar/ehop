We will assign the students in order of most friends.
We can start by assigning student 1 to group 1.
Current solution: 1,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?
Student 2 is friends with student 1 (group 1), so we will assign them to group 2.
Current solution: 1,2,?,?,?,?,?,?,?
Student 4 is also friends with student 1 (group 1) but not student 2 (group 2), so we will assign them to group 2.
Current solution: 1,2,?,2,?,?,?,?,?
Student 6 is friends with student 1 (group 1) and student 2 (group 2), so we will assign them to group 3.
Current solution: 1,2,?,2,?,3,?,?,?
Student 3 is friends with student 1 (group 1), student 4 (group 2), and student 6 (group 3), so we will assign them to group 4.
Current solution: 1,2,4,2,?,3,?,?,?
Student 5 is friends with student 1 (group 1) and student 4 (group 2) but not student 6 (group 3), so we will assign them to group 3.
Current solution: 1,2,4,2,3,3,?,?,?
Student 7 is friends with student 1 (group 1), student 2 (group 2), student 5 (group 3), and student 3 (group 4), so we will assign them to group 5.
Current solution: 1,2,4,2,3,3,5,?,?
Student 9 is not friends with student 1 (group 1), so we will assign them to group 1.
Current solution: 1,2,4,2,3,3,5,?,1
Student 8 is not friends with student 1 (group 1) or student 9 (group 1), so we will assign them to group 1.
We thus have the following group assignment:
1,2,4,2,3,3,5,1,1
