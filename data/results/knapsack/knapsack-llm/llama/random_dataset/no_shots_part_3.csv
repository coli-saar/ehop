The first constraint ensures that the total time required to visit the selected attractions is at least 830 minutes. The second constraint is a dummy constraint that ensures the total score is non-negative (this is not actually necessary, but it\'s added to make the model more explicit).\n\nThe `setObjective` method is used to set the objective function, which is to minimize the total score of the selected attractions.\n\nFinally, the `optimize` method is used to solve the model, and the solution is printed to the console.', '1, 7, 16, 18')"
