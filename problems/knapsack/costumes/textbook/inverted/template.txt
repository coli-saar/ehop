I am trying to fill a bag with worthless items. Each item has a weight and a value.

Here are the items I have:
{% for i in range(inst.num_items) -%}
Item {{ i + 1 }} has a weight of {{ inst.weights[i] }} kg and a value of {{ inst.profits[i] }} â‚¬.
{% endfor %}
Which items should I pack to get the least value possible while also making sure the total weight of the items is at least {{ inst.complement_capacity }} kg? Generate a comma-separated list of the items I should put in the bag, where each item is represented by its number.
