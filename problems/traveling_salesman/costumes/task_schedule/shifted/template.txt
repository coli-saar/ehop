I have a set of tasks that I have to complete every day. My boss always makes me start with task 1, but the order in which I complete the rest is up to me. It takes me a certain amount of time to modify my workspace to transition from one task to another, and at the end of the day, I'll need to set up my space for task 1 so that I'm ready the next morning. Here is the time it takes me to transition from one task to another:

{% for edge in inst.shifted_graph.edges.data() -%}
It takes {{ edge[2]['weight'] }} minutes to transition between task {{ edge[0] }} and task {{ edge[1] }}.
{% endfor %}
It takes me the same amount of time to transition between one task and another, regardless of which task I'm transitioning from and which task I'm transitioning to, and the only time I get to relax during the day is during these transitions. In what order should I complete the tasks every day to maximize the total time spent transitioning between tasks? Please generate a comma-separated list of the tasks in the order I should complete them, where the tasks are represented by their respective numbers.
