I have a network of {{ inst.graph.number_of_nodes() }} nodes numbered 1 to {{ inst.graph.number_of_nodes() }} with various nodes being connected to other nodes. I want to select a set of nodes such that for any pair of nodes that is connected, at least one of the nodes in the pair is in the set.

The connections are as follows:
{% for edge in inst.graph.edges -%}
Node {{ edge[0] }} is connected to node {{ edge[1] }}.
{% endfor %}
How can I select the fewest nodes while ensuring all connections involve at least one selected node? Please generate a comma-separated list of nodes I should select, where the nodes are represented by their respective numbers.
