We start with task 1 first, and the remaining order is undecided.
Current Task Order: 1    Remaining Tasks: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Of the remaining tasks, task 8 takes the least time to transition from task 1 (24 minutes), so we add it to the order.
Current Task Order: 1,8    Remaining Tasks: 2,3,4,5,6,7,9
Of the remaining tasks, task 3 takes the least time to transition from task 8 (13 minutes), so we add it to the order.
Current Task Order: 1,8,3    Remaining Tasks: 2,4,5,6,7,9
