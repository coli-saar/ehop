I have a network of {{ inst.graph.number_of_nodes() }} nodes numbered 1 to {{ inst.graph.number_of_nodes() }} with various nodes being connected to other nodes. I want to select a set of nodes such that all the other nodes are connected to at least one node in the set.

The connections are as follows:
{% for edge in inst.graph.edges -%}
Node {{ edge[0] }} is connected to node {{ edge[1] }}.
{% endfor %}
How can I select the fewest nodes while ensuring all other nodes are connected to at least one selected node? Please generate a comma-separated list of nodes I should select, where the nodes are represented by their respective numbers.
An example of a correctly formatted output for a network with three nodes could be "1,2" (without the quotes).
