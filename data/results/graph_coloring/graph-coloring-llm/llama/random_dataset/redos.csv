Nodes 1 and 2 are both colored 1.,"('My birthday is coming up, and I want to celebrate with my 9 friends. Some of my friends used to be in romantic relationships with each other, and they don\'t get along anymore. I will therefore be having multiple birthday parties. I want to invite each person to one party, and I want to make things as awkward as possible, so I only want to invite two people to the same party if they used to be in a relationship. I have a list of who used to date whom, and I want to host as few parties as possible while avoiding having a pair of people who haven\'t dated at the same party.\n\nThe past relationships are as follows:\nFriend 1 and friend 3 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 1 and friend 9 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 2 and friend 3 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 2 and friend 4 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 2 and friend 5 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 2 and friend 7 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 3 and friend 4 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 3 and friend 5 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 3 and friend 8 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 4 and friend 5 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 4 and friend 6 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 4 and friend 7 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 4 and friend 8 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 5 and friend 6 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 5 and friend 8 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 6 and friend 7 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 6 and friend 8 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 6 and friend 9 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 7 and friend 9 used to be in a relationship.\nFriend 8 and friend 9 used to be in a relationship.\n\nWhich party should each friend be invited to? Generate a comma-separated list with each friend\'s party, where the parties are represented by integers ranging from 1 to the total number of parties.

The objective function minimizes the maximum party number used, which corresponds to the minimum number of parties needed.\n\nThe constraints `c0` to `c19` ensure that if two friends used to be in a relationship, they are assigned to the same party.
