I am trying to fill a knapsack with items. Each item has a weight and a value.

Find a set of items such that that the total value is as low as possible,
but also so that there are no remaining items which can still fit in the knapsack.
The knapsack can hold {{ inst.capacity }} kg.

Here are the items I have:

{% for i in range(inst.num_items) -%}
Object {{ i }} has a weight of {{ inst.weights[i] }} kg and a value of {{ inst.profits[i] }}.
{% endfor %}
Generate a comma-separated list of the names of the object you put in the knapsack.
