The problem is that the constraints are not correctly modeling the problem. We want to assign each friend to a party, and we want to make sure that no two friends who used to date are in the same party.\n\nA better formulation would be to use binary variables to represent the assignment of friends to parties. Let $x_{ij}$ be a binary variable that is 1 if friend $i$ is assigned to party $j$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nHere is the corrected ILP formulation:\n\n```\n\\ This is a birthday party problem\n\nMinimize\n  p\nSubject To\n  c0: x11 + x12 + x13 + x14 + x15 + x16 + x17 = 1\n  c1: x21 + x22 + x23 + x24 + x25 + x26 + x27 = 1\n  c2: x31 + x32 + x33 + x34 + x35 + x36 + x37 = 1\n  c3: x41 + x42 + x43 + x44 + x45 + x46 + x47 = 1\n  c4: x51 + x52 + x53 + x54 + x55 + x56 + x57 = 1\n  c5: x61 + x62 + x63 + x64 + x65 + x66 + x67 = 1\n  c6: x71 + x72 + x73 + x74 + x75 + x76 + x77 = 1\n  c7: x12 + x22 <= 1\n  c8: x22 + x32 <= 1\n  c9: x22 + x42 <= 1\n  c10: x22 + x72 <= 1\n  c11: x32 + x72 <= 1\n  c12: x42 + x52 <= 1\n  c13: x42 + x72 <= 1\n  c14: x52 + x62 <= 1\n  c15: x52 + x72 <= 1\n  c16: p >= x11 + x21 + x31 + x41 + x51 + x61 + x71\n  c17: p >= x12 + x22 + x32 + x42 + x52 + x62 + x72\n  c18: p >= x13 + x23 + x33 + x43 + x53 + x63 + x73\n  c19: p >= x14 + x24 + x34 + x44 + x54 + x64 + x74\n  c20: p >= x15 + x25 + x35 + x45 + x55 + x65 + x75\n  c21: p >= x16 + x26 + x36 + x46 + x56 + x66 + x76\n  c22: p >= x17 + x27 + x37 + x47 + x57 + x67 + x77\nBounds\n  1 <= p\n  0 <= x11 <= 1\n  0 <= x12 <= 1\n  0 <= x13 <= 1\n  0 <= x14 <= 1\n  0 <= x15 <= 1\n  0 <= x16 <= 1\n  0 <= x17 <= 1\n  0 <= x21 <= 1\n  0 <= x22 <= 1\n  0 <= x23 <= 1\n  0 <= x24 <= 1\n  0 <= x25 <= 1\n  0 <= x26 <= 1\n  0 <= x27 <= 1\n  0 <= x31 <= 1\n  0 <= x32 <= 1\n  0 <= x33 <= 1\n  0 <= x34 <= 1\n  0 <= x35 <= 1\n  0 <= x36 <= 1\n  0 <= x37 <= 1\n  0 <= x41 <= 1\n  0 <= x42 <= 1\n  0 <= x43 <= 1\n  0 <= x44 <= 1\n  0 <= x45 <= 1\n  0 <= x46 <= 1\n  0 <= x47 <= 1\n  0 <= x51 <= 1\n  0 <= x52 <= 1\n  0 <= x53 <= 1\n  0 <= x54 <= 1\n  0 <= x55 <= 1\n  0 <= x56 <= 1\n  0 <= x57 <= 1\n  0 <= x61 <= 1\n  0 <= x62 <= 1\n  0 <= x63 <= 1\n  0 <= x64 <= 1\n  0 <= x65 <= 1\n  0 <= x66 <= 1\n  0 <= x67 <= 1\n  0 <= x71 <= 1\n  0 <= x72 <= 1\n  0 <= x73 <= 1\n  0 <= x74 <= 1\n  0 <= x75 <= 1\n  0 <= x76 <= 1\n  0 <= x77 <= 1\nBinaries\n  x11 x12 x13 x14 x15 x16 x17\n  x21 x22 x23 x24 x25 x26 x27\n  x31 x32 x33 x34 x35 x36 x37\n  x41 x42 x43 x44 x45 x46 x47\n  x51 x52 x53 x54 x55 x56 x57\n  x61 x62 x63 x64 x65 x66 x67\n  x71 x72 x73 x74 x75 x76 x77\nGenerals\n  p\nEnd\n```\n\nThis formulation uses binary variables to represent the assignment of friends to parties, and constraints to ensure that no two friends who used to date are in the same party.

A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph such that every two vertices in the subset are connected by an edge.\n\nLet's represent the students as vertices and the friendships as edges. We can then look for cliques in the graph.\n\nFrom the given friendships, we can see that students 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 form a clique, since each of them is friends with every other student in this group.\n\nStudent 2 is friends with students 5 and 6, but not with students 1, 3, 4, or 7. Therefore, student 2 cannot be in the same group as students 1, 3, 4, or 7.\n\nHowever, student 2 can be in the same group as students 5 and 6. Since students 5 and 6 are already in the clique with students 1, 3, 4, and 7, we can create a new group with students 2, 5, and 6.

We can put students 1, 3, 4, and 7 in one group, and students 2, 5, and 6 in another group.

The constraints ensure that each friend attends exactly one party, and that no two friends who used to date each other attend the same party. The objective function minimizes the number of parties used.\n\nNote that the `max_parties` variable is an upper bound on the number of parties, which is set to the number of friends in this case. This is a common technique in ILP to avoid having to specify the exact number of parties in advance.\n\nYou can run this model using the `gurobipy` library and examine the solution to determine which party each friend should be invited to.', '2,3,3,3,2,3,2')"

Each participant is a node, and two nodes are connected by an edge if the corresponding participants are not competing against each other. We want to color the nodes (assign rooms) such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\nFrom the given matchups, we can construct the graph:\n\n* Participant 1 is not competing against participants 4 and 7.\n* Participant 2 is not competing against participants 4, 6, and 7.\n* Participant 3 is not competing against participants 2 and 7.\n* Participant 4 is not competing against participants 1, 2, 5, and 6.\n* Participant 5 is not competing against participants 4 and 7.\n* Participant 6 is not competing against participants 2, 4, and 5.\n* Participant 7 is not competing against participants 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nNow, we can try to color the nodes. We start with participant 1 and assign them to room 1. Since participants 4 and 7 are not competing against participant 1, they can be in the same room as each other, but not in room 1. We assign them to room 2.\n\nParticipant 2 is not competing against participants 4 and 7, so they can be in room 1 with participant 1. Participant 3 is not competing against participant 2, but is competing against participant 1, so they cannot be in room 1. Participant 3 can be in room 2 with participants 4 and 7.\n\nParticipant 5 is not competing against participant 4, but is competing against participants 1 and 3, so they cannot be in rooms 1 or 2. We assign participant 5 to room 3.\n\nParticipant 6 is not competing against participant 2, but is competing against participants 1 and 3, so they cannot be in rooms 1 or 2. Participant 6 can be in room 3 with participant 5.\n\nNow, we have assigned rooms to all participants. Here is the list of rooms:\n\n1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2"
