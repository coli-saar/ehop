There will be representatives from 4 nations sitting at a round table. The representative from nation 1 will be leading the discussion, so they will be sitting in the designated ""Director Seat,"" but nothing else is decided yet. There is some amount of political tension between each pair of nations, and I\'ve been given a list of tension scores for each pair of representatives, with higher scores indicating higher tension. Here are the tension levels between each pair of representatives:\n\nRepresentative 1 and representative 2 have tension score 2.\nRepresentative 1 and representative 3 have tension score 13.\nRepresentative 1 and representative 4 have tension score 14.\nRepresentative 2 and representative 3 have tension score 4.\nRepresentative 2 and representative 4 have tension score 5.\nRepresentative 3 and representative 4 have tension score 11.\n\nI want to maximize the total tension between adjacent pairs of representatives to encourage discussion and progress. What should the seating order be, starting at the ""Director Seat"" and continuing clockwise? Note that the last person in the ordering will also be sitting next to the Director Seat. Please generate a comma-separated list of the representatives in the order they should be seated, where the representatives are represented by their respective numbers.\n\nPlease express this as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) problem in the LP format.\nHere is an example of the LP file format:\n```\n\\ This is a comment\n\nMaximize\n  3 a + 2 b + c - 2 d\nSubject To\n  c0: a + b = 1\n  c1: b + c >= 0\n  c2: a + c < 4\nBounds\n  1 <= c <= 5\n  2 <= d\nBinaries \\ these are binary variables that can only be 0 or 1\n  a b\nGenerals \\ these are integer variables\n  c d\nEnd\n```\nNOTE: Keep in mind that all constraints must have only terms with variables on the left and only constant terms on the right (note that ""a <= b"" can be instead written as ""a - b <= 0"").\'', ""An error occurred while Gurobi was solving the ILP problem:\n\nUnable to retrieve attribute 'X'\n\nInstead of fixing the ILP specification, please provide a final answer for the problem.
