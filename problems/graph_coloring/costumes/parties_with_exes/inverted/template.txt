My birthday is coming up, and I want to celebrate with my {{ inst.graph.number_of_nodes() }} friends. Some of my friends used to be in romantic relationships with each other, and they don't get along anymore. I will therefore be having multiple birthday parties. I want to invite each person to one party, and I want to make things as awkward as possible, so I only want to invite two people to the same party if they used to be in a relationship. I have a list of who used to date whom, and I want to host as few parties as possible while avoiding having a pair of people who haven't dated at the same party.

The past relationships are as follows:
{% for edge in inst.complement_graph.edges -%}
Friend {{ edge[0] }} and friend {{ edge[1] }} used to be in a relationship.
{% endfor %}
Which party should each friend be invited to? Generate a comma-separated list with each friend's party, where the parties are represented by integers ranging from 1 to the total number of parties. The parties should be in the order of the friends' numbers, so the first party in the list will correspond to friend 1, the second party will correspond to friend 2, and so on.
