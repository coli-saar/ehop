I have a list of numbers, and I'd like to split the list into two subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is the same.
The list of numbers is as follows:
{{ inst.numbers }}

Please generate a comma-separated list of the numbers which should be in the first subset. Each value in the list should be a number from my list, and a number can appear at most as many times in your list as it does in mine.

Should I rewrite this to make it truly a decision problem?
Should I add an example output somehow? If so, how?
#}
